Telegram Notifier
=================

Kibitzr supports sending notifications through `Telegram IM`_.
Setup process consists of 4 steps:

1. Create Bot with `BotFather`_
2. Save telegram token to ``kibitzr-creds.yml``
3. Write a message (anything) to you new bot
4. Run ``kibitzr telegram_chat``
5. Save the result to ``kibitzr-creds.yml``

Notes
-----

Telegram bots `don't have an ability to search for users`_,
that's why one have to write a message to bot instead of providing username in configuration.
Also, bots have a short memory. Message sent a week ago will be likely inaccessible for a bot.
That's why, you have to save chat id explicitly.
Kibitzr will send messages to chat, where first message was sent to bot
(like `filial imprinting`_).

Telegram has a `maximum message length of 4096 utf-8 characters`_. Telegram Notify will check this
for you and split the message in to multiple messages of 4096 characters each. Messages doesn't
necessarely get delivered, by the telegram network, in the same order that they are sent.

Example of ``kibitzr-creds.yml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    telegram:
        token: 334539109:ABHCRz_snz8554qsSlIIotMaNFWB3p8P84
        chat: 118860645


Also chat identifier can be configured for each check in ``kibitzr.yml`` using following syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml

    checks:
      ...
        notify:
          - telegram: 118860645
